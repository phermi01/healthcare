# OVERVIEW
Welcome to my healthcare analysis, which aims to guide health facility in making informed decision using healthcare dataset. This Project is one of my Portfolio projects towards the completion of my course in Python for Data Analytics offered by Regonet Global. This project seeks to offer data-driven solution for potential issues in healthcare facilities.

The dataset is synthetic which was created to provide valuable resource for data analyst. The data was designed to mimic real-world healthcare data so as to enable analysts profer near real-world solution to probable  problems faced by healthcare industry.

# The Questions
Below are the questions I seek to answer in my analysis:
1. Are certain medical conditions more prevalent in one gender compared to the other?
2. Which age and gender groups are underrepresented in hospital admissions?
3. Are emergency admissions overwhelming elective service and straining resources?
4. Is there a rising demand for impatient care that indicates the need for ward or ICU expansion?
5. Which medical condition contributes most to hospital billing and costs
6. Do disease incidence and staffing needs vary by season or months?
7. Are some doctors managing significantly higher patient loads than others?

# Tools I Used
I harnessed the functionality of several key tools for my analysis of the healthcare dataset analysis.

Python was the backbone of my analysis which enables me to analyze the data and provide critical insights

I also deployed the following Python libraries:

1. Pandas Library: This was used to analyze the data.
2. Matplotlib Library: I used it to visualized the data.
3. Seaborn Library: Helped me create more advanced visuals.
4. Visual Studio Code: My go-to for executing my python scripts
5. Jupyter Notebooks: The tools I used to run my Python scripts which let me easily include my noted and analysis.
6. Git & GitHub: Essential for version control and sharing my Python code and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# Data Preparation and Cleanup
This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

Import and Cleanup Data: I began by importing neccessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.

``` Python
# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from datasets import load_dataset
from adjustText import adjust_text
import seaborn as sns
import re
from datetime import datetime
import plotly.express as px
%matplotlib inline

# loading the dataset
health = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\DELL\Desktop\Regonet_project\healthcare_dataset.csv")

# Creating a copy of the dataset
health_1 = health.copy()

# Removing extra leading and trailing spaces from text-based columns
for col in health_1.select_dtypes(include='object'):
    health_1[col] = health_1[col].map(lambda x: re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', x).strip() if isinstance(x,str) else x)
    
# Converting the name coulmn to title case
health_1['Name'] = health_1['Name'].str.title()

# Renaming some columns to comply with python naming conventions
health_1.rename(columns={'Blood Type': 'Blood_Type','Medical Condition': 'Medical_Condition', 
                         'Date of Admission': 'Date_of_Admission', 'Insurance Provider': 'Insurance_Provider',
                         'Billing Amount': 'Billing_Amount','Room Number':'Room_Number',
                         'Admission Type':'Admission_Type', 'Discharge Date': 'Discharge_Date',
                         'Test Results':'Test_Results'
}, inplace=True)

# Converting the Date of Admission and Discharge Date to datetime format
health_1['Date_of_Admission'] = pd.to_datetime(health_1['Date_of_Admission'], errors='coerce').dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
health_1['Discharge_Date'] = pd.to_datetime(health_1['Discharge_Date'], errors='coerce').dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')

# cleaning the Hospital column by removing commas and extra spaces
health_1['Hospital'] = (
    health_1['Hospital']
    .str.replace(',', '', regex=False) 
    .str.strip()                         
)

# Converting billing amount coulmn to 2 decimal palces
health_1['Billing_Amount'] = health_1['Billing_Amount'].round(2)

# checking dataet after cleaning
health_1.sample(10, random_state=42)
```

# The Anlysis

## 1. Assessing Gender Disparities in the Prevalence of Medical Conditions

### Visualizing Data

``` python
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 6))
palette = sns.color_palette("tab20", n_colors=grouped['Medical_Condition'].nunique())

# Using pandas crosstab to plot stacked bars
pivot_df = pd.crosstab(health_1['Gender'], health_1['Medical_Condition'])

# Plotting of stacked bars
bottom = pd.Series([0]*len(pivot_df), index=pivot_df.index)
for i, condition in enumerate(pivot_df.columns):
    sns.barplot(x=pivot_df.index, y=pivot_df[condition], label=condition,
                bottom=bottom, color=palette[i])
    bottom += pivot_df[condition]
    
plt.title("Diagnosis Prevalence by Gender")
plt.xlabel("Gender")
plt.ylabel("Number of Diagnoses")
plt.xticks(rotation=0)
plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)

# Positioning of legend
plt.legend(title='Medical Condition', bbox_to_anchor=(1.02, 1), loc='upper left')
